GSA GENERAL PLUGIN LICENSE
                       Version 1.2, October 2021

 GSA General Plugin License ( GSA GPL ) is a license created
 by GSA to protect their intellectual property jobs.

 The use of this license is only allowed to GSA members.


What is GSA GPL?

GSA GPL ( GSA General Plugin License ) is a license created on January 2020 to protect GSA resources
from copy & paste into not-allowed projects. This is because some of our resources contains code that took hours or even months to
make or work. With the idea of protecting our time, the GSA GPL license was created. This is not a public license, and only GSA
members are able to use it. As there are a lot of "GSA" groups, we will provide our discord link as "group identifier". Any member
of that discord group with the role CEO or Developer can use GSA GPL license freely on their projects.


Conditions

Before starting with the conditions, we must clarify when this license is applied. If specified in
README.*, the license will be applied to the whole code, otherwise, if it's not specified in README.* or it doens't exist, any class
/file/method with "Private GSA code" will be under this license. If specified in README.* and anyway, also specified separately in
the class/file/method with the "Private GSA code" comment, this will be also under GSA GPL license.
If the comment is not
literally "Private GSA code", but similar ( like "private gsa code", "gsa code" ) or contains it. Will be also took as "Private GSA
code" and the class/file/method will be also under GSA GPL license.


- By decompiling or opening a GSA protected project/resource/object you are automatically accepting GSA
GPL therms and conditions.

- To use any class/file/method protected by GSA, you must ask permission to use it, in our discord
providing a valid email address.

- If the license gets updated, you are forced to accept new conditions or cancel the permission to use it.
You will be notified by email. If you decline, you won't be able to use the private GSA code anymore until you ask again for
permission.


- Using any class/file/method protected by GSA, will require a link to the original author project or site.


- Modifying GSA protected code is completely forbbiden, even with the correspondent access, this will not
be tolerated. In case you modify/use private GSA code without a valid license, legal actions will be taken. If you have a valid
license, that license will be revoked. You can suggest a code change, without modifying the original one, but the code you suggest
to change/add will be also under GSA license even it doesn't has the private GSA comment.


- Before publishing a resource that contains private GSA code, will require a request to the GSA code
author. If declined, you are free to ask what changes does your project need to be published. You have also the right to create a
vote in the discord to let the users choose if the project will be published or not. If the users decide to accept the project.


- By creating a vote for a project to be accepted, you will lose access to more GSA private code ( you
will be restricted to the code you are currently using, if your project has GSA code but it's not really being used, you will also
lose access to that GSA code ).


- Using a project that contains GSA code without a valid license and without GSA approvation, is
forbbiden. If you found one, please stop using it, notify the project author and report it to our discord.
